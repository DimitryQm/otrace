**Type-aware, variadic key/values for Instants (since 0.2.0)**

Instants can now carry multiple key/value pairs in a single emission, and values may be numeric or strings. The spellings stay the same `TRACE_INSTANT_KV` for the zero-category form and `TRACE_INSTANT_CKV` when you want a category, but under the hood they route to a variadic, type-aware path. If you were previously constrained to a single numeric value, that limitation is gone; mixed sets like `("phase", 2, "stage", "copy", "ok", 1)` are valid and preserved in the output JSON. Nothing about the semantics of instants changed: they are still zero-duration markers with arguments serialized under `args`. The only difference is expressive power and fewer calls on the hot path when you want to attach several small facts to the same moment.
